// BluStryx8
Player
> Fixed an issue relating to weapon cooldown and inaccuracy
> Made all weapons now render smaller when dropped if they were not originally 64x64.
  They do have bigger hitbox as an interesting side effect.
> Weapons now render in hand at a 1x size. This means some sprites need to be resized.
  Also, two handed weapons still need catering for.
> Added notes missing from Friday's changes.
