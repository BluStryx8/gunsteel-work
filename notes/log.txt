Player
+ Added some bullets.
+ Added sprite format note, for further reference.
> Filler gun has been changed to 0.75x size. May rework guns completely so it can render at 1x instead
> Changed global declaration into a script rather than objects. You don't need objects to just run one script, it's less effecient.
