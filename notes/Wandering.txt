Movement check

var _tries = 0

{
	_tries += 1;					// Increase try count, up to 5 tries
	direction = irandomrange(1, 8); // Choose a random direction: up, down, left, right or diagonals
	
	// Check the maximum distance it can move before colliding with wall.
	// Reduce that maximum distance by an amount so it does not hug the wall.
	// If this maximum distance is too small, retry the check.
	// Once a direction has been decided, choose a distance to move between min and max
	// Then set _tries = 6 once a direction is set.
